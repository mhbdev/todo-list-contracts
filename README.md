# TON Todo List Smart Contracts

Welcome to the TON Todo List smart contract repository!

This repository contains the FunC smart contracts for a simple todo list application built on the TON blockchain. The contracts handle the creation, modification, and deletion of todo items in a decentralized and immutable manner.

## Key Features:

* Creating new List
* Create new todo items
* Mark todo items as completed

## How it works:

A detailed explanation of the contract logic and functionalities can be found in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@Mhbdev/lets-create-a-todo-list-smart-contract-a8fdcbd9d9f0)
The contracts are written in FunC and compiled for the TON blockchain.
